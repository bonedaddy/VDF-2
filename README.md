# VDF
Weak Verifiable Delay Function with modular square root

We built a python and solidity implementation of randomness beacon with a weak verifiable delay function that uses a classic modular square-root method (Sloth). 
This project is built on VDF [research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf) by Dan Boneh, Joseph Bonneau, Benedikt Bunz, and Ben Fisch


The solidity contract is built from a SHA3 implementation of proof of delay from this [research](http://www.jbonneau.com/doc/BGB17-IEEESB-proof_of_delay_ethereum.pdf)
